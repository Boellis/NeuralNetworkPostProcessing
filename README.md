Neural Network Post Processing
========

Post Processing for Unity using Convolution Neural Network. CNN Model trained with pix2pix/GAN, Fast Neural Style Transfer 
You can create your style offline and train the network with your own data, making your NNPP!

* Trainer with pix2pix or fast-style-transfer
* Keras model and weight discription to Unity
